Watch as I try my hardest to teach myself Java! So far, I have watched about 30 minutes worth of two different videos, and I now know the basics.

My first completed project was "Eon's Temperature Converter" (very basic, I know). It was completed on the 1st of October, 2025, after about two days of work. UPDATE: It is, in fact, not done.

My second project in the works is "Eon's Great Adventure," which I hope will become a little "choose your own adventure" game. This project was started on the 1st of October, 2025, and will be updated as I work.

Thank you for reading, stranger! Or possibly Eon from the future! In which case, fuck off, asshole! ;)
